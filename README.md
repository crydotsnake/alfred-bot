# Alfred Bot

## Description
Alfred is a friendly bot that comes with different commands.

### Setup
1. Clone the project
2. Create a `.env` file in the root folder.
3. Get your DISCORD_TOKEN and SERVER_GUILD_ID and use them in the `.env` file.

#### Example

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR-TOKEN
SERVER_GUILD_ID=YOUR-GUILD_ID
```

Its a just for fun project. I dont have any ideas where this is going.
